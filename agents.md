## 🔧 Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Modular Component Architecture
**Decision**: Break monolithic `script.js` into focused components
**Rationale**: 
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Reduced complexity per file

### 2. Dependency Injection Pattern
**Decision**: Components receive dependencies rather than creating them
**Rationale**:
- Loose coupling between components
- Easier testing and mocking
- Clear dependency relationships
- Flexible component replacement

### 3. Backward Compatibility Strategy
**Decision**: Support old data formats while introducing new features
**Rationale**:
- Existing user data remains valid
- Smooth migration path
- No data loss during updates
- Gradual feature adoption

### 4. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Comprehensive error checking with user-friendly messages
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience
- Easier debugging
- Graceful degradation
- Clear error reporting

### 5. Chart Height Management
**Decision**: Dynamic height calculation with fallbacks
**Rationale**:
- Full-screen chart experience
- Responsive design
- Works across different screen sizes
- Handles edge cases gracefully

## 🎯 Design Patterns Used

### 1. **Facade Pattern** (`app.js`)
- Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
- Hides component complexity from HTML handlers
- Single point of control

### 2. **Strategy Pattern** (Override handling)
- Different strategies for old vs new override formats
- Pluggable calculation methods
- Extensible for future override types

### 3. **Observer Pattern** (Chart hover)
- Chart events trigger UI updates
- Loose coupling between chart and summary display
- Event-driven architecture

### 4. **Factory Pattern** (Data creation)
- Standardized loan and override creation
- Validation and transformation in one place
- Consistent data structure

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. **Identify the appropriate component** based on responsibility
2. **Add new methods to existing components** rather than creating new files
3. **Use dependency injection** for component communication
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** when changing data formats
5. **Add error handling** for all user-facing operations

### Modifying Existing Features
1. **Check impact on other components** before making changes
2. **Update both new and legacy code paths** if applicable
3. **Test with existing data files** to ensure compatibility
4. **Update this documentation** if architectural decisions change

### Code Style Guidelines
1. **Use descriptive class and method names**
2. **Add JSDoc comments** for public methods
3. **Handle errors gracefully** with user feedback
4. **Use consistent formatting** (currency, dates, etc.)
5. **Validate user input** before processing

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. **Direct DOM Manipulation in Business Logic**
- ❌ Don't access DOM elements in calculator or data manager
- ✅ Use UI manager for all DOM operations

### 2. **Tight Coupling Between Components**
- ❌ Don't directly instantiate other components
- ✅ Use dependency injection and interfaces

### 3. **Global State Mutations**
- ❌ Don't modify global variables directly
- ✅ Use component methods for state changes

### 4. **Hardcoded Values**
- ❌ Don't hardcode dimensions, colors, or business rules
- ✅ Use configuration objects or CSS variables

## 🔄 Migration History

### From Monolithic to Modular (Current)
**Problem**: Single 1000+ line `script.js` with syntax errors and maintenance issues
**Solution**: Broke into 6 focused components with clear responsibilities
**Benefits**: 
- Eliminated syntax errors
- Easier debugging
- Better code organization
- Improved maintainability

### Override System Evolution
**V1**: Single net worth override
**V2**: Dual override system (savings + loan balance)
**Rationale**: More granular control and accuracy in financial modeling

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies for unit testing
- Test both success and error paths

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between components
- Test with real user scenarios

### Compatibility Testing
- Test with old data formats
- Verify migration paths work correctly
- Ensure no data loss during updates

## 📈 Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **TypeScript Migration**: Add type safety and better IDE support
2. **State Management**: Consider Redux/Vuex for complex state
3. **Component Framework**: Migrate to React/Vue for better component model
4. **Testing Framework**: Add Jest/Mocha for automated testing
5. **Build Process**: Add webpack/vite for optimization

### Scalability Considerations
- Current architecture supports up to ~50 components
- Consider micro-frontend approach for larger applications
- Database integration for server-side persistence
- API layer for multi-user scenarios
